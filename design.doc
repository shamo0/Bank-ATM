How does your system store the keys and PINs? 
Where and how do you use cryptographic schemes?
    We have public/private key pairs stored in the ssATM/ssBank files which
    are later used for RSA signature when we establish the connection. These 
    signatures provide integrity, confidentiality, and authentication for the transfer of a the session key. The communication
    between the atm and the bank is also encrypted using AES-GCM mode in order
    to provide confidentiality, along with integrity from the tag.

What are the messages that the bank and the ATM exchange for each transaction? 
Describe the format of each message.
    Each message sent by both the atm and the bank is a json object containing 
    the nonce, ciphertext and the tag.

The structure of the cards.
    Cards contain random hashes, in order to provide an extra layer 
    of security the hashes later get checked with the correct user in the ssBank 
    when the user tries to authenticate.

=======================================
Message Syntax (current) 

For all of these messages, they will be signed by the private keys of the 
bank or atm depending on the originator.

ATM -> BANK
=====================
Begin session:
{operation: begin, user: userID, Auth(pin/key): pin}

Withdraw:
{operation: withdraw, user: userID, amount: amnt}

Balance:
{operation: balance, user: userID}


BANK -> ATM
=====================
After getting a begin session:
{operation: responseStartSession, user: userID}

On Bank Deposit:
{operation: onBankDeposit, user: userID}

After getting a balance request:
{operation: returnBalance, user: userID, balance: balance}

AFter getting a withdrawal:
{operation: returnBalance, user: userID, amount: amount, success:bool}

On an error (impossible withdrawal, wrong pin, bad balance req):
{operation: returnError, user: userID}
