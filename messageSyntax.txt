For all of these, they will be signed by the private keys of the 
bank or atm depending on the originator.

ATM -> BANK, what if we used json? json.dumps(dict) before transmission, json.loads(str) on recv
=====================
Begin session:
{operation: begin, user: userID, Auth(pin/key): pin}

Withdraw:
{operation: withdraw, user: userID, Auth(pin/key): pin, amount: amnt}

Balance:
{operation: balance, user: userID, Auth(pin/key): pin}

end-session: 
just end for now, could implement session tokens later

BANK -> ATM
=====================
After getting a begin session:
{operation: responseStartSession, user: userID}

After getting a balance request:
{operation: responseBalance, user: userID, balance: balance}

AFter getting a withdrawal:
{operation: responseWithdrawal, user: userID, amount: amount, sucess:bool}

On an error (impossible withdrawal, wrong pin, bad balance req):
{operation: responseError, user: userID, msg: Message}
